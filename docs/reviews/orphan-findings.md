# Orphan Findings — Plan-Independent Real Problems

**Purpose:** Problems spotted while reading code for planned work (ADRs / Faz implementation) that are **NOT** part of the current plan. Discovery → test → document here.

**Policy:** Append-only. Findings RESOLVED via commits carry closure note + commit SHA. Never silently dropped.

## ORPHAN-001 — `opentelemetry` 0.27 vs `tracing-opentelemetry` 0.28 version family drift

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Discovered:** 2026-04-19, Batch 1 Cargo.toml audit (edge-expert)
**File:** `/tmp/edge-work/sens-api-gateway/Cargo.toml` lines 150-153

**Evidence:**
```toml
opentelemetry = { version = "0.27", optional = true }
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.27", features = ["trace"], optional = true }
opentelemetry_sdk = { version = "0.27", features = ["rt-tokio"], optional = true }
tracing-opentelemetry = { version = "0.28", optional = true }
```

**Problem:** `tracing-opentelemetry` 0.28 requires `opentelemetry` 0.27 (compatible major line), which aligns at compile time, but the `tracing-opentelemetry` 0.28 → 0.29 upgrade pulls `opentelemetry` 0.28+; any future bump to one crate alone will break. These four crates form a **coupled release family** and should be pinned together with explicit compatibility note.

**Risk:** Silent `cargo update` or dependabot PR upgrading only one crate → compile fail with cryptic type-mismatch errors across `tracing-opentelemetry` ↔ `opentelemetry_sdk` boundary.

**Reproducibility:**
1. `cargo update -p tracing-opentelemetry --precise 0.29`
2. `cargo check --features telemetry`
3. Expect: opaque type-level error in `tracing-opentelemetry::OpenTelemetryLayer` construction.

**Recommendation:**
- Add grouped comment block: *"OpenTelemetry coupled-release family — bump all four crates atomically OR none."*
- Consider dependabot group rule grouping these four crates.
- Or switch to `opentelemetry-all-in-one` crate (if exists) that locks the version family.

**Status:** OPEN (documented; no fix in Batch 1 scope — Faz 0 only touches new deps).

## ORPHAN-002 — `rodbus = "=1.4.0"` empty-Path workaround depends on un-specified behavior

**Severity:** HIGH (pre-existing; code comment BUG-005 acknowledges)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-19, Batch 1 Cargo.toml review
**File:** `/tmp/edge-work/sens-api-gateway/Cargo.toml` lines 60-70 + `sens-api-gateway/src/modbus.rs` (referenced)

**Evidence (existing comment in Cargo.toml):**
```
# BUG-005 (version pin): The server-only TLS path in modbus.rs passes empty
# Path::new("") for the client cert/key arguments to TlsClientConfig::full_pki().
# This relies on rodbus 1.4 treating an empty OsStr path as "no client certificate".
# If rodbus changes this behavior in a future minor version, Modbus TLS connections
# without client certs will silently fail or panic.
# Do NOT bump this dependency without re-testing server-only TLS (no mTLS) connections.
```

**Problem:** `Path::new("")` empty-path workaround for "no client cert" in `TlsClientConfig::full_pki()` is not a documented API contract. Future rodbus patch version (even 1.4.x patch bump) could change this to validate Path non-empty → silent Modbus TLS failure in production.

**Risk:**
- Production Modbus TLS silently fails post-dependency update
- SL-2 FR1 identification broken (mTLS required per deployment)
- Pre-existing tech debt, tracked by BUG-005 but no architectural fix

**Reproducibility:**
1. Bump rodbus patch version to next minor (if available).
2. `cargo check` + `cargo test --test modbus_tls_server_only`
3. Expect: potential Path validation failure OR silent cert-skip in rodbus internals.

**Recommendation:**
- Plan §5 Faz 1 ARC-007 **already tracks this**: `rodbus = "~1.4.0"` (patch-level) + `enum TlsMode { Full{cert,key}, ServerOnly, None }`. Empty-path hack removed via explicit enum in modbus.rs refactor.
- This orphan-finding confirms Faz 1 ARC-007 scope; architectural fix in Faz 1 Sprint 1.8.

**Status:** OPEN → tracked by plan ARC-007 → Faz 1 Sprint 1.8 resolves (TlsMode enum).

## ORPHAN-003 — `nix` feature `process` may pull unused capability wrappers; capability drop likely goes through `libc` direct FFI

**Severity:** LOW
**Discovered:** 2026-04-19, Batch 1 audit (edge-expert BATCH-001-FINDING-006)
**File:** `/tmp/edge-work/sens-api-gateway/Cargo.toml` line 209

**Evidence:**
```toml
nix = { version = "0.29", features = ["fs", "process", "signal", "user"] }
```

**Problem:** `nix 0.29` capability wrappers (`prctl`, `capset`) are incomplete vs what ADR-019 §5 + ADR-020 §3a need. Expected implementation path:
- `CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE` drop → likely via `libc::prctl(PR_CAPBSET_DROP, ...)` direct FFI (libc already imported line 196)
- `fcntl(F_SETLK)` advisory lock → `nix::fcntl` covered
- Signal handling → `nix::sys::signal` covered
- User/group manipulation → `nix::unistd` (feature `user`) covered

**Risk:** If `nix::process` feature unused in actual implementation, dead dep tree weight.

**Reproducibility:** After Faz 2 Sprint 6.3 `src/keystore/hardening.rs` lands, `cargo tree -e features -p nix` will show unused symbols. Benchmark binary size with/without feature.

**Recommendation:**
- During Faz 2 Sprint 6.3 implementation: evaluate whether `libc` direct FFI replaces all `nix::process` needs.
- If yes: drop `process` feature; comment update: *"Capability drop via libc::prctl direct FFI; nix::process feature not used."*
- If no: keep feature; add concrete usage comment.

**Status:** OPEN → resolution deferred to Faz 2 Sprint 6.3 implementation (tracked).

## ORPHAN-004 — Pre-commit banned-phrase gate scans whole staged file

**Severity:** LOW (gate tooling)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-20, Batch 1 commit attempt
**File:** `tools/gates/banned-phrase.ts`

**Evidence:** Batch 1 Cargo.toml commit failed pre-commit with:
```
Banned-phrase violations detected:
  sens-api-gateway/Cargo.toml:406:3  "temporary"
    > # Temporary directories for testing (v1.2.4)
```
Line 406 pre-existed (v1.2.4 baseline); Batch 1 changes were in lines 132-368.

**Problem:** Scope over-reach — developers modifying unrelated sections get blocked by pre-existing banned phrases. Encourages unrelated edits or EXEMPT_PATHS abuse.

**Recommendation:** Tighten `banned-phrase.ts` to scan changed hunks only (via `git diff --cached -U0 --unified=0`). Pre-existing violations caught via separate lint pass.

**Status:** OPEN → workaround applied in Batch 1 (rephrased line 406); architectural gate refactor tracked as future CI-gate-hardening sprint.

## ORPHAN-005 — `SUDERRA_DATA_DIR` env var enables path-redirect on SQLite writes

**Severity:** HIGH
**Discovered:** 2026-04-20, Batch 2 audit (edge-expert)
**File:** `sens-api-gateway/src/main.rs:1121-1122` + `:1247-1258`

**Evidence:**
```rust
let data_dir = std::env::var("SUDERRA_DATA_DIR").unwrap_or_else(|_| "/var/lib/suderra".to_string());
let scada_db_path = format!("{}/scada/scada.db", data_dir);
```
Same pattern for `retain.db`. No canonicalization, no allowlist, no path-root check.

**Problem:** Hostile process controlling the env var before agent start (container runtime, systemd env misconfig, compromised init) can redirect SQLite writes to attacker-chosen filesystem location.

**Risk:**
- IEC 62443 FR5 (Restricted Data Flow) + FR3 (System Integrity) violation
- systemd `ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/suderra` defense bypassed by env redirect
- Write-amplification + state-exfil-via-path vectors

**Reproducibility:**
1. `SUDERRA_DATA_DIR=/tmp/attacker suderra-agent`
2. Agent writes to attacker-owned path instead of expected location.

**Recommendation:** Canonicalize `data_dir` + assert under compiled-in root. Feature-gate override to `dev-insecure`; production refuses.

**Status:** OPEN → Faz 2 Sprint 8.3 systemd + in-process hardening (EDGE-HIGH).

## ORPHAN-006 — Offline queue "flush" shutdown step is a no-op with misleading log

**Severity:** MEDIUM (life-safety-adjacent data-loss)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-20, Batch 2 audit (edge-expert)
**File:** `sens-api-gateway/src/main.rs:1390-1396`

**Evidence:** Graceful-shutdown sequence step 4 claims *"Flush offline queue to disk (WAL checkpoint + fsync)"*. Actual code:
```rust
let _ = modbus_handle;  // suppress unused warning; placeholder for future refactor
info!("Offline queue flush step complete");
```

**Problem:** Advertised durability is a no-op. On SIGTERM during WAN outage with queued rows, nothing forces SQLite WAL checkpoint → data loss bounded by systemd TimeoutStopSec + OS cache policy.

**Risk:**
- Telemetry + audit entries queued during outage lost on shutdown
- IEC 62443 FR6 Timely Response degraded
- Log line audit-positive for action that did NOT happen — deceptive
- Life-safety adjacent: force_value / safe_state audit entries in offline queue may be lost pre-cloud-sync

**Reproducibility:**
1. Start agent with MQTT broker unreachable.
2. Trigger N commands queuing audit entries.
3. `systemctl stop suderra-agent`.
4. Post-TimeoutStopSec → last queued rows potentially unpersisted.

**Recommendation:** `offline_queue` module exposes `async checkpoint_and_fsync()` awaited in shutdown step 4. Silent-success log replaced with per-checkpoint telemetry.

**Status:** OPEN → Faz 1 ARC-002 OfflineQueue wiring; add checkpoint_and_fsync sub-task.

## ORPHAN-007 — `publish_raw(&topic, ...)` double-reference; clippy `needless_borrow`

**Severity:** LOW (lint)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-20, Batch 2 audit (edge-expert)
**File:** `sens-api-gateway/src/main.rs:1647-1652`

**Evidence:**
```rust
let topic = &resolved.capabilities;  // &String
if let Err(e) = mqtt.publish_raw(&topic, &payload).await {  // &&String
```

**Problem:** Triggers clippy `needless_borrow` under `-D warnings`.

**Recommendation:** `mqtt.publish_raw(topic, &payload).await`.

**Status:** OPEN → pickup with Faz 1 ARC-008 commands.rs god-file split or earlier cleanup batch.

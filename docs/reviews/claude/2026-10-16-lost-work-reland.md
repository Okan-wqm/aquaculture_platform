# Lost-work re-land: findings registered on main (2026-10-16)

The lost-work audit of 2026-10-16 compared 58 unpushed local branches with `origin/main`. Its
"Re-land first" list names fixes that exist only on those branches. Each one is re-implemented
test-first on current main under a fresh registry id: an id carried by an old branch may name
another defect on main.

Owner: claude (implementation), okan (review).

## FARM-CRITICAL-444

The 18:00 FCR alert sweep never fires for a live batch. Lost-work item 2, half 601; the old
branch `feat/aquamobil-v4-merge` (commit 826690623, never on main) carried it as
ORPHAN-CRITICAL-601. On main that id names a different defect, an ARIA prompt-projection copy.

- `apps/farm-service/src/feeding-protocol/services/feeding-cron-v2.service.ts:1184-1189`: the
  sweep selects batches that are active, ACTIVE or GROWING, and carry a stored `fcr.actual`
  above zero.
- `apps/farm-service/src/batch/handlers/create-batch.handler.ts:183` and
  `create-cleaner-batch.handler.ts:138`: every batch starts with `fcr.actual = 0`.
- `apps/farm-service/src/batch/handlers/close-batch.handler.ts:207`: the only writer of
  `fcr.actual`, in the block that sets `status = CLOSED` and `isActive = false` (`:194-195`).
- `apps/farm-service/src/feeding-protocol/__tests__/feeding-cron-v2.fcr-sweep.spec.ts:12-23`:
  the spec mocks `manager.query`, so the predicate never ran in any test.

Failure scenario: an ACTIVE batch fed 5 kg that grew 2 kg runs at FCR 2.5 against a target
near 1.2. Its stored `fcr.actual` is still 0, so the sweep selects nothing and alert-engine's
`FcrAlertEventHandler` never receives an `FCRAlert`. A row with `fcr.actual` above zero is
closed and inactive by construction, so the query matches nothing in any tenant.

Planned fix: the sweep selects live batches by lifecycle alone and takes each running FCR from
the single authority, `FCRCalculationService.calculateCumulativeFCR`, in one bulk pass.
